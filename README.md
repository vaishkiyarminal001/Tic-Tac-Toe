# Tic-Tac-Toe

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="100%" src="/Screenshot (972).png">

<h2>This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in a grid of 3x3 cells. The objective is to form a line of three symbols (either ‚ùå or ‚≠ï) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</h2>

<h3>Game Features:</h3>

Grid: The game is played on a grid consisting of nine cells arranged in a 3x3 layout. Each cell can be clicked to place a player's symbol (‚ùå or ‚≠ï).

Turn Indicator: The current player's turn is indicated at the top of the game interface. It displays the symbol (‚ùå or ‚≠ï) and provides information on whose turn it is.

Game Logic: Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol. The game ensures that only empty cells can be clicked, and each cell can only be selected once. After each move, the game checks for a winning combination or a draw.

Winning Condition: If a player successfully aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game declares them as the winner. The winning player is celebrated with a üòé emoji.

Draw Condition: If all the cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is declared a draw. Players receive a üò¢ emoji to indicate a draw.

Restart: After the game ends (either due to a win or a draw), players can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button. This clears the board and resets the game state, allowing players to play again and enjoy the game.
